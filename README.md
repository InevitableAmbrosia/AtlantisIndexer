With this webapp code you can make your own public BitTorrent indexer using WebTorrent, totally free. WebTorrent allows torrents to be downloaded in the Browser. 

The database uses Neo4j and there is a graph visualizer on the front-end.

To interface between WebTorrent browser and WebTorrents on the Desktop, the only BitTorrent client that currently works is BiglyBT with the WebTorrent plugin, so use that.

My site is hosted at propagate.info, and it is for public domain ebooks, audiobooks, classical music, and documentaries. 

Open an Issue if you're interested in using the code and I will streamline the process to configure an admin account and create a fresh website. I have not done this yet, as there is no interest so far.

I can also modify the code to make it invite only, so that you can host a private BitTorrent indexer, upon interest.
