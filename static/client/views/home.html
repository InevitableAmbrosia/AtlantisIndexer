    The name propagate.info comes from the Catholic Society for the Propagation of the Faith, a term I learned about in a Subversive Writing class at Cornell. This educational BitTorrent indexer was originally intended to strenghten American Democracy by facilitating education and the spirit of wisdom and knowledge. You can contribute by downloading and seeding, uploading public domain works, and self-publishing your own ebooks, audiobooks, Classical Music, and Documentaries!!!
    <br><br>It is a dynamic, community-driven peer-to-peer alternative to sites like Project Gutenberg and Archive.org, which host your files on a centralized server. BitTorrent puts the ownership of media, especially public domain educational material, in the hands of the people, and allows for a Open Source community spirit to develop. Think of it like Wikipedia for Primary Sources, using WebTorrent! 
    <br><br>Torrents can be downloaded in the Browser using WebTorrent if people seed using BiglyBT with the WebTorrent plugin. The programming stack for this possibly Web3.0 WebApp is Neo4J, JQuery Tables, node.js, WebTorrent, and an in-house router called ANCHOR.js, an alternative to the Corporate AngularJS and ReactJS. My vision has been dreamt from the classic Gazelle, a Web2.0 private BitTorrent Indexer. Like Gazelle, we have a Top10, edition headings, Author nodes, Classes, graph visualization, and self-publishing, which advances on the bulky enterprise of Archive.org and the bare-bones interface of Project Gutenberg, while adding Top10 filters, a VR Graph Search, and WebTorrent. The code is Open Source (the router, too) and available for free on <a target="_blank" href="github.com/InevitableAmbrosia/DaishoninLibrary">GitHub!</a>. Please email me if you need help setting up your own Daishonin BitTorrent Indexer. 
    <br><br>I am still deciding whether to found a 501(c)3 non-profit or to make money off crypto, without taking royalties for self-published media in either case. The idea for this site was originally given to me by Rama, and the intention was to foster the spirit of knowledge in America by detaching social media from capital gain. In Athens, the Architeture of the Public Square is sometimes said to have facilitated the Birth of Democracy, as an idea. Since code is like architecture, the idea is that thru "yogic programming," programming without desire for fruit of results, we may create an open space that is generative of knowledge and creativity. I now have a Bodhisattva vow which allows me to facilitate the Enlightenment of the Other, and I know that the path to wealth is not the Path to Nirvana. 
    <br><br>We do not collect any user data except uploads when logged in. Your (coming-soon) copyrighted media purchases are recorded so that you continue to have access to your purchases while logged in. We do not record snatches (downloads)!
    <br><br>Please enjoy this website, download all manner of files even just to be a seeder, taking the time to use BiglyBT with the WebTorrent Plugin, and upload public domain educational media and your own works of knowledge and wisdom, ILLUMINATING THE STATE OF ENLIGHTENMENT!!!
    <!--<a href="#" id="moar">Read more</a><span id="about_hidden">The Github Repo for this project is <a href="https://github.com/InevitableAmbrosia/DaishoninLibrary">github.com/InevitableAmbrosia/DaishoninLibrary</a>. The programming stack for this project is all Open Source, and is Neo4J, JQuery Datatables, D3 Force Graph VR, WebTorrent, and NodeJS.
    <br><br>The code I have developed over 8 years is a free architecture for American Civil Society which allows for public domain, self-published, and copyrighted educational media to be transferred over BitTorrent, with Web3 crypto transactions processed via Chainlink. The original impetus for this work is to strengthen American Democracy thru the free and Open Source architecture of Civil Society. Files can also be downloaded in the Browser using WebTorrent. This site is legal under US Law, so we host only public domain torrents and torrents uploaded by the copyright holder. If you are outside of America, please ensure that the torrents you download are in fact legal to download in your region!!!
    <br><br>The dynamic class system along with the Top10 and Graph Search shall allow users to constantly find new media that interests them. Our educational media and Open Source code shall trickle up into the Public Sphere to foster research into and Learning of science, religion, politics, literary theory, and especially ethics.
    <br><br>I have endeavored to submit to the ideal of the Bodhisattva, dedicating my life to the Enlightenment of Others. Enlightenment means liberation, which is consistent with freedom of speech and the Enlightenment ideals of freedom of religion! Because the road that leads to wealth is not the road that leads to Enlightenment (The Dhammapada), we take no royalties from LINK transfers for copyrighted works. You may Self-Publish your information so that it is displayed <a href="#publisher?publisher=propagate.info" class="ANCHOR publisher">HERE</a></a> as an alternative to other publishing paths by setting "propagate.info" as your Publisher on the Upload Page! Please enjoy and feel free to make profit thru this BitTorrent Indexer as you see fit.<br><br>
    Our Privacy Policy is that we only save user uploads, LINK addresses for uploaders, forum posts, and infoHash purchases. Your list of uploads is hidden to others by default, which can be changed by unchecking the "Paranoia" checkbox on your User page. While this would be useful for finding recommended Sources, we do not save user downloads, as this would fill up the Database with too many nodes.
  <br><br>Please share the Knowledge of Solomon's Hope with all your friends on Social Media and elsewhere!</span>!-->
